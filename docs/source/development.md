# Developing mass-driver

Read below the project's "Development" section of the README for guidance on development.

## Makefile

In order to automate (less typing) and document (list in one place) the
development commands, a `Makefile` is provided at the repo's root.

See it here:

```{literalinclude} ../../Makefile
---
language: make

```
