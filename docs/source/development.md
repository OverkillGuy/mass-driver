# Developing mass-driver

Read the project's ["Development" section of the README](index) for guidance on development.


## Makefile

In order to automate (less typing) and document (list in one place) the
development commands, a `Makefile` is provided at the repo's root.

See it here:

```{literalinclude} ../../Makefile
---
language: make
---
```
