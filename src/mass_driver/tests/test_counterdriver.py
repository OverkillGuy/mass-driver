"""Tests to validate the Counter driver is valid

Counter is just about the simplest driver we can make, so showcasing it is kinda neat.#


Feature: Validate the Counter Driver
  As the mass-driver dev
  I need to write test harness for a simple PatchDriver
  To template it for downstream plugin-driver developers

Sample config files counter_config1.toml and counter_config2.toml are set up for the
Counter driver with target values 1 and 2 respectively, with counter's in-repo data
being set to 1. This validates both the case for bumping by 1, and the case where
bumping is not needed.
