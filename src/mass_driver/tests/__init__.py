"""Tests that validate that mass-driver does its job.

In particular, these tests are packaged inside mass-driver itself
(src/mass_driver/tests/) rather than testing externally (tests/), which means downstream
package users (such as mass-driver plugin creators) benefit from the fixtures defined
here.
